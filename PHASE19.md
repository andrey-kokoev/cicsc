## CICSC Phase 19: Generalized Deployment Assurance and Transition Readiness

Phase 19 starts after Phase 18 closure and focuses on generalized deployment
assurance while preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 19:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Deployment-assurance validation closure
3. Runtime reliability hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 20 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- generalized deployment assurance is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- runtime reliability hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P19.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 19 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P19.1.1 Freeze Phase 19 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P19.1.2 Publish Phase 19 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P19.1.3 Add Phase 19 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 19 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P19.2: Deployment-Assurance Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close deployment-assurance validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [x] P19.2.1 Freeze deployment-assurance matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P19.2.2 Run deployment-assurance required gates.
- [x] P19.2.3 Publish deployment-assurance closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] Deployment-assurance validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P19.3: Runtime Reliability Hardening

### Outcome
Harden runtime reliability checks for scaled deployments.

### TODOs
- [x] P19.3.1 Freeze runtime-reliability hardening matrix and policy.
- [ ] P19.3.2 Add runtime-reliability verification harnesses.
- [ ] P19.3.3 Publish runtime reliability closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Runtime reliability remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P19.4: Governance Closure and Phase 20 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 19 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 20.

### TODOs
- [ ] P19.4.1 Define objective Phase 19 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P19.4.2 Add PHASE19↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P19.4.3 Add Phase 20 block gate from Phase 19 checklist.
- [ ] P19.4.4 Publish Phase 19 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 20 remains blocked unless Phase 19 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 19)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Deployment-assurance validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Runtime reliability is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 20 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
