## CICSC Phase 28: Assurance Scaling and Operational Continuity Discipline

Phase 28 starts after Phase 27 closure and focuses on assurance scaling while
preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 28:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Assurance-scaling validation closure
3. Operational-continuity hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 29 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- assurance scaling is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- operational-continuity hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P28.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 28 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P28.1.1 Freeze Phase 28 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P28.1.2 Publish Phase 28 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [ ] P28.1.3 Add Phase 28 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 28 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P28.2: Assurance-Scaling Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close assurance-scaling validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [ ] P28.2.1 Freeze assurance-scaling matrix and evidence contract.
- [ ] P28.2.2 Run assurance-scaling required gates.
- [ ] P28.2.3 Publish assurance-scaling closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Assurance-scaling validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P28.3: Operational-Continuity Hardening

### Outcome
Harden operational-continuity checks for expanded deployments.

### TODOs
- [ ] P28.3.1 Freeze operational-continuity hardening matrix and policy.
- [ ] P28.3.2 Add operational-continuity verification harnesses.
- [ ] P28.3.3 Publish operational-continuity closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Operational-continuity hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P28.4: Governance Closure and Phase 29 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 28 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 29.

### TODOs
- [ ] P28.4.1 Define objective Phase 28 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P28.4.2 Add PHASE28↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P28.4.3 Add Phase 29 block gate from Phase 28 checklist.
- [ ] P28.4.4 Publish Phase 28 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 29 remains blocked unless Phase 28 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 28)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Assurance-scaling validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Operational-continuity hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 29 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
