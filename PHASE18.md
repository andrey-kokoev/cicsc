## CICSC Phase 18: Expansion Proof and Production-Grade Continuity

Phase 18 starts after Phase 17 closure and focuses on scaling expansion proof
evidence while preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 18:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Expansion-proof validation closure
3. Production-grade continuity hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 19 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- expansion-proof evidence is pass-backed across declared surfaces,
- production continuity hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P18.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 18 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P18.1.1 Freeze Phase 18 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P18.1.2 Publish Phase 18 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P18.1.3 Add Phase 18 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 18 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P18.2: Expansion-Proof Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close expansion-proof validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [x] P18.2.1 Freeze expansion-proof matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P18.2.2 Run expansion-proof required gates.
- [x] P18.2.3 Publish expansion-proof closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] Expansion-proof validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

## Milestone P18.3: Production-Grade Continuity Hardening

### Outcome
Harden production continuity checks for scaled deployments.

### TODOs
- [ ] P18.3.1 Freeze production-continuity hardening matrix and policy.
- [ ] P18.3.2 Add production-continuity verification harnesses.
- [ ] P18.3.3 Publish production continuity closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Production continuity remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P18.4: Governance Closure and Phase 19 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 18 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 19.

### TODOs
- [ ] P18.4.1 Define objective Phase 18 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P18.4.2 Add PHASE18↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P18.4.3 Add Phase 19 block gate from Phase 18 checklist.
- [ ] P18.4.4 Publish Phase 18 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 19 remains blocked unless Phase 18 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 18)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Expansion-proof validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Production continuity is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 19 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
