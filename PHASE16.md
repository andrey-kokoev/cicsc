## CICSC Phase 16: External Validation and Expansion Readiness

Phase 16 starts after Phase 15 closure and focuses on external validation loops
and expansion readiness under unchanged invariants and governance discipline.

Execution sequence for Phase 16:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. External validation and evidence expansion
3. Deployment/operations expansion hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 17 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- external validation evidence is integrated into objective closure,
- expansion readiness remains conformance-backed and migration-safe,
- transition governance remains artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P16.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 16 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P16.1.1 Freeze Phase 16 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P16.1.2 Publish Phase 16 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P16.1.3 Add Phase 16 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 16 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P16.2: External Validation and Evidence Expansion

### Outcome
Expand objective evidence from internal envelope to explicit external-validation
coverage.

### TODOs
- [x] P16.2.1 Freeze external-validation matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P16.2.2 Run external-validation required gates.
- [x] P16.2.3 Publish external-validation closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] External validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P16.3: Deployment and Operations Expansion Hardening

### Outcome
Harden deployment/operations readiness for expansion without invariant regressions.

### TODOs
- [ ] P16.3.1 Freeze deployment-expansion hardening matrix and policy.
- [ ] P16.3.2 Add expansion-readiness verification harnesses.
- [ ] P16.3.3 Publish expansion hardening closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Expansion-readiness status remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P16.4: Governance Closure and Phase 17 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 16 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 17.

### TODOs
- [ ] P16.4.1 Define objective Phase 16 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P16.4.2 Add PHASE16↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P16.4.3 Add Phase 17 block gate from Phase 16 checklist.
- [ ] P16.4.4 Publish Phase 16 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 17 remains blocked unless Phase 16 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 16)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] External-validation closure is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Expansion-readiness status is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 17 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
