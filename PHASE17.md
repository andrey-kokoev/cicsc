## CICSC Phase 17: Field Program Scaling and Trust Hardening

Phase 17 starts after Phase 16 closure and focuses on scaling field-program
evidence while preserving invariant, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 17:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Field-program validation expansion
3. Trust and operations hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 18 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- field-program evidence scales without semantic regressions,
- trust/operations hardening is explicit and executable,
- governance remains artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P17.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 17 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P17.1.1 Freeze Phase 17 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P17.1.2 Publish Phase 17 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P17.1.3 Add Phase 17 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 17 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P17.2: Field-Program Validation Expansion

### Outcome
Scale field-program validation with objective evidence contracts and closure
discipline.

### TODOs
- [x] P17.2.1 Freeze field-program validation matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P17.2.2 Run field-program required gates.
- [x] P17.2.3 Publish field-program closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] Field-program validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P17.3: Trust and Operations Hardening

### Outcome
Strengthen trust and operational hardening for scaled deployments.

### TODOs
- [x] P17.3.1 Freeze trust/operations hardening matrix and policy.
- [x] P17.3.2 Add trust/operations verification harnesses.
- [ ] P17.3.3 Publish trust hardening closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Trust and operations status remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P17.4: Governance Closure and Phase 18 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 17 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 18.

### TODOs
- [ ] P17.4.1 Define objective Phase 17 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P17.4.2 Add PHASE17↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P17.4.3 Add Phase 18 block gate from Phase 17 checklist.
- [ ] P17.4.4 Publish Phase 17 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 18 remains blocked unless Phase 17 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 17)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Field-program validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Trust/operations hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 18 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
