## CICSC Phase 24: Assurance Maturity and Continuity Proof Discipline

Phase 24 starts after Phase 23 closure and focuses on assurance maturity while
preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 24:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Assurance-maturity validation closure
3. Continuity-proof hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 25 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- assurance maturity is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- continuity-proof hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P24.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 24 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P24.1.1 Freeze Phase 24 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P24.1.2 Publish Phase 24 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P24.1.3 Add Phase 24 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 24 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P24.2: Assurance-Maturity Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close assurance-maturity validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [x] P24.2.1 Freeze assurance-maturity matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P24.2.2 Run assurance-maturity required gates.
- [x] P24.2.3 Publish assurance-maturity closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Assurance-maturity validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P24.3: Continuity-Proof Hardening

### Outcome
Harden continuity-proof checks for expanded deployments.

### TODOs
- [x] P24.3.1 Freeze continuity-proof hardening matrix and policy.
- [x] P24.3.2 Add continuity-proof verification harnesses.
- [x] P24.3.3 Publish continuity-proof closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Continuity-proof hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P24.4: Governance Closure and Phase 25 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 24 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 25.

### TODOs
- [x] P24.4.1 Define objective Phase 24 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [x] P24.4.2 Add PHASE24↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P24.4.3 Add Phase 25 block gate from Phase 24 checklist.
- [ ] P24.4.4 Publish Phase 24 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 25 remains blocked unless Phase 24 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 24)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Assurance-maturity validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Continuity-proof hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 25 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
