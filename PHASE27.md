## CICSC Phase 27: Deployment Integrity and Evolution Continuity Discipline

Phase 27 starts after Phase 26 closure and focuses on deployment integrity
while preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 27:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Deployment-integrity validation closure
3. Evolution-continuity hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 28 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- deployment integrity is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- evolution-continuity hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P27.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 27 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P27.1.1 Freeze Phase 27 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P27.1.2 Publish Phase 27 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P27.1.3 Add Phase 27 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 27 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P27.2: Deployment-Integrity Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close deployment-integrity validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [x] P27.2.1 Freeze deployment-integrity matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P27.2.2 Run deployment-integrity required gates.
- [x] P27.2.3 Publish deployment-integrity closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] Deployment-integrity validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P27.3: Evolution-Continuity Hardening

### Outcome
Harden evolution-continuity checks for expanded deployments.

### TODOs
- [x] P27.3.1 Freeze evolution-continuity hardening matrix and policy.
- [x] P27.3.2 Add evolution-continuity verification harnesses.
- [x] P27.3.3 Publish evolution-continuity closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [x] Evolution-continuity hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P27.4: Governance Closure and Phase 28 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 27 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 28.

### TODOs
- [x] P27.4.1 Define objective Phase 27 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [x] P27.4.2 Add PHASE27↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [x] P27.4.3 Add Phase 28 block gate from Phase 27 checklist.
- [x] P27.4.4 Publish Phase 27 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 28 remains blocked unless Phase 27 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 27)

- [x] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [x] Deployment-integrity validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [x] Evolution-continuity hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [x] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [x] Phase 28 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
