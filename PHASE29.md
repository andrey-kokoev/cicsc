## CICSC Phase 29: Assurance Expansion and Governance Continuity Discipline

Phase 29 starts after Phase 28 closure and focuses on assurance expansion while
preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 29:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Assurance-expansion validation closure
3. Governance-continuity hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 30 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- assurance expansion is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- governance-continuity hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P29.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 29 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P29.1.1 Freeze Phase 29 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P29.1.2 Publish Phase 29 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P29.1.3 Add Phase 29 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 29 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P29.2: Assurance-Expansion Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close assurance-expansion validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [x] P29.2.1 Freeze assurance-expansion matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P29.2.2 Run assurance-expansion required gates.
- [ ] P29.2.3 Publish assurance-expansion closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Assurance-expansion validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P29.3: Governance-Continuity Hardening

### Outcome
Harden governance-continuity checks for expanded deployments.

### TODOs
- [ ] P29.3.1 Freeze governance-continuity hardening matrix and policy.
- [ ] P29.3.2 Add governance-continuity verification harnesses.
- [ ] P29.3.3 Publish governance-continuity closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Governance-continuity hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P29.4: Governance Closure and Phase 30 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 29 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 30.

### TODOs
- [ ] P29.4.1 Define objective Phase 29 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P29.4.2 Add PHASE29↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P29.4.3 Add Phase 30 block gate from Phase 29 checklist.
- [ ] P29.4.4 Publish Phase 29 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 30 remains blocked unless Phase 29 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 29)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Assurance-expansion validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Governance-continuity hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 30 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
