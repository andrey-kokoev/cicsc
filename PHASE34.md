## CICSC Phase 34: Field Generalization and Multi-Context Validation

Phase 34 focuses on generalizing the system to multiple contexts and validating them
under expanded objective envelopes.

Execution sequence for Phase 34:
1. Multi-Context Validation Expansion
2. Generalization Closure Gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- multi-context validation is evidence-backed across declared envelopes,
- workloads are executable under expanded objective envelopes,
- incident and drift localization is governed by forced-next mapping policy.

---

## Milestone Y1: Multi-Context Validation Expansion

### Outcome
Expand multi-context validation with explicit matrices and executable workloads.

### TODOs
- [x] AY1.1 Freeze Phase 34 context matrix and expanded acceptance contract.
- [x] AY1.2 Execute multi-context workloads under expanded objective envelopes.
- [x] AY1.3 Publish incident and drift localization report with forced-next mapping policy.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 34 context matrix and acceptance contract are frozen.
- [x] Multi-context workloads are executed with evidence.
- [x] Drift localization report is published with forced-next policy.

---

## Milestone Y2: Generalization Closure Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 34 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 35.

### TODOs
- [ ] AY2.1 Add Phase 34 required-gates script/report for expanded multi-context envelope.
- [ ] AY2.2 Publish Phase 34 closure report with unresolved critical disposition.
- [ ] AY2.3 Define objective Phase 34 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] AY2.4 Add Phase 35 block gate from Phase 34 checklist.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 35 remains blocked unless Phase 34 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 34)

- [ ] Multi-context validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Workloads are executed under expanded objective envelopes.
- [ ] Drift localization is governed by explicit mapping policy.
- [ ] Phase 35 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
