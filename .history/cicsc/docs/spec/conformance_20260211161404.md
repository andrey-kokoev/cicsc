# CICSC Conformance Requirements (Normative)

## 0. Status

This document defines conformance requirements for CICSC v0 implementations.

This specification is normative.

---

## 1. Compiler Conformance

A compiler conforms to CICSC v0 iff:

- it compiles Spec DSL to Core IR v0 without extensions  
- it rejects Specs that cannot be lowered to Core IR v0  
- it enforces semantic closure  
- it emits deterministic Core IR  

---

## 2. Runtime Conformance

A runtime conforms to CICSC v0 iff:

- it executes only Core IR-derived behavior  
- it enforces guards and constraints  
- it appends events immutably  
- it applies reducers deterministically  
- it enforces SLAs  
- it supports replay verification  

---

## 3. Adapter Conformance

An adapter conforms to CICSC v0 iff:

- it implements the Target Adapter Interface  
- it declares capabilities truthfully  
- it rejects unsupported Core IR constructs  
- it preserves Core IR semantics  
- it enforces transactional guarantees  

---

## 4. Migration Conformance

Migration handling conforms to CICSC v0 iff:

- migrations are total  
- migrations are executable  
- migrations are replay-verified  
- migrations do not mutate history in-place  

---

## 5. Operational Conformance

An operator conforms to CICSC v0 iff:

- all changes occur via Spec + compile + migrate + cutover  
- no out-of-band changes occur  
- replay verification is enforced before cutover  

---

## 6. Audit Conformance

Audit trails MUST include:

- Spec version  
- Core IR hash  
- migration hash  
- replay verification result  
- timestamp  

---

## 7. Non-Conformance

Any violation of this document invalidates CICSC conformance.

Non-conforming systems MUST NOT claim CICSC compatibility.
