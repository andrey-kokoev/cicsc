## CICSC Phase 13: Operational Scale Closure Under Categorical Guarantees

Phase 13 starts after Phase 12 closure and pushes the system from bounded
envelope confidence toward sustained operational scale while preserving kernel
and category-model conformance.

Execution sequence for Phase 13:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Operational scale envelope expansion
3. Migration and parity hardening at scale
4. Governance closure and Phase 14 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- scaled deployment operation remains invariant-preserving,
- migration/parity guarantees hold under larger execution envelopes,
- phase transition governance remains artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P13.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Begin Phase 13 from explicit scope and reproducible baseline status.

### TODOs
- [x] P13.1.1 Freeze Phase 13 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P13.1.2 Publish Phase 13 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P13.1.3 Add Phase 13 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 13 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P13.2: Operational Scale Envelope Expansion

### Outcome
Expand operational scale envelope with objective gate-backed evidence.

### TODOs
- [x] P13.2.1 Freeze scale envelope matrix and workload contract.
- [x] P13.2.2 Run scale workload suites with required gates.
- [x] P13.2.3 Publish scale envelope report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] Scale envelope expansion is evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P13.3: Migration and Parity Hardening at Scale

### Outcome
Strengthen migration/parity conformance for scale envelope operations.

### TODOs
- [x] P13.3.1 Freeze migration+parity hardening matrix.
- [ ] P13.3.2 Add differential harnesses for scale hardening matrix.
- [ ] P13.3.3 Publish hardening closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P13.4: Governance Closure and Phase 14 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 13 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 14.

### TODOs
- [ ] P13.4.1 Define objective Phase 13 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P13.4.2 Add PHASE13↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P13.4.3 Add Phase 14 block gate from Phase 13 checklist.
- [ ] P13.4.4 Publish Phase 13 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 14 remains blocked unless Phase 13 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 13)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Scale envelope expansion is objective and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Migration/parity hardening is differentially validated.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 14 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
