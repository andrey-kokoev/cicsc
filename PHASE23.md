## CICSC Phase 23: Integrity Scaling and Runtime Assurance Discipline

Phase 23 starts after Phase 22 closure and focuses on integrity scaling while
preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 23:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Integrity-scaling validation closure
3. Runtime-assurance hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 24 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- integrity scaling is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- runtime-assurance hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P23.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 23 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P23.1.1 Freeze Phase 23 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P23.1.2 Publish Phase 23 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P23.1.3 Add Phase 23 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 23 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P23.2: Integrity-Scaling Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close integrity-scaling validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [x] P23.2.1 Freeze integrity-scaling matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P23.2.2 Run integrity-scaling required gates.
- [x] P23.2.3 Publish integrity-scaling closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] Integrity-scaling validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P23.3: Runtime-Assurance Hardening

### Outcome
Harden runtime-assurance checks for expanded deployments.

### TODOs
- [x] P23.3.1 Freeze runtime-assurance hardening matrix and policy.
- [x] P23.3.2 Add runtime-assurance verification harnesses.
- [x] P23.3.3 Publish runtime-assurance closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [x] Runtime-assurance hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P23.4: Governance Closure and Phase 24 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 23 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 24.

### TODOs
- [x] P23.4.1 Define objective Phase 23 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [x] P23.4.2 Add PHASE23↔Execution Ledger drift consistency gate.
- [x] P23.4.3 Add Phase 24 block gate from Phase 23 checklist.
- [x] P23.4.4 Publish Phase 23 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 24 remains blocked unless Phase 23 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 23)

- [x] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [x] Integrity-scaling validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [x] Runtime-assurance hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [x] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [x] Phase 24 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
