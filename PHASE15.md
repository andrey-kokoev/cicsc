## CICSC Phase 15: Objective Closure and Deployment Discipline

Phase 15 starts after Phase 14 closure and focuses on objective-scorecard
closure, deferred-surface governance, and explicit deployment discipline for the
next expansion wave.

Execution sequence for Phase 15:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Objective scorecard expansion and closure
3. Deferred-surface and deployment discipline hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 16 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- objective evidence is consolidated and pass-backed for declared CICSC goals,
- deferred SQL/parity/ops items are either closed or explicitly re-gated,
- deployment discipline is checkable before widening phase scope again.

---

## Milestone P15.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 15 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P15.1.1 Freeze Phase 15 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P15.1.2 Publish Phase 15 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P15.1.3 Add Phase 15 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 15 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P15.2: Objective Scorecard Expansion and Closure

### Outcome
Consolidate objective scorecard evidence and enforce pass/fail closure rules.

### TODOs
- [x] P15.2.1 Freeze objective scorecard matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P15.2.2 Run objective scorecard required gates.
- [x] P15.2.3 Publish objective closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] Objective closure remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P15.3: Deferred-Surface and Deployment Discipline Hardening

### Outcome
Close or explicitly re-gate deferred surface while hardening deployment checks.

### TODOs
- [x] P15.3.1 Freeze deferred-surface closure matrix and policy.
- [x] P15.3.2 Add deployment-discipline verification harnesses.
- [x] P15.3.3 Publish deferred-surface closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [x] Deferred-surface status and deployment discipline remain explicit and governed.

---

## Milestone P15.4: Governance Closure and Phase 16 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 15 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 16.

### TODOs
- [ ] P15.4.1 Define objective Phase 15 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P15.4.2 Add PHASE15↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P15.4.3 Add Phase 16 block gate from Phase 15 checklist.
- [ ] P15.4.4 Publish Phase 15 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 16 remains blocked unless Phase 15 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 15)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Objective scorecard closure is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Deferred-surface status and deployment discipline are verifiable.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 16 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
