## CICSC Phase 21: Cross-Environment Stability and Operational Continuity Discipline

Phase 21 starts after Phase 20 closure and focuses on cross-environment
stability while preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 21:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Cross-environment stability validation closure
3. Operational continuity hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 22 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- cross-environment stability is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- operational continuity hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P21.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 21 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P21.1.1 Freeze Phase 21 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P21.1.2 Publish Phase 21 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P21.1.3 Add Phase 21 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 21 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P21.2: Cross-Environment Stability Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close cross-environment stability validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [x] P21.2.1 Freeze cross-environment stability matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P21.2.2 Run cross-environment stability required gates.
- [x] P21.2.3 Publish cross-environment stability closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] Cross-environment stability validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P21.3: Operational Continuity Hardening

### Outcome
Harden operational continuity checks for expanded deployments.

### TODOs
- [x] P21.3.1 Freeze operational-continuity hardening matrix and policy.
- [x] P21.3.2 Add operational-continuity verification harnesses.
- [x] P21.3.3 Publish operational-continuity closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [x] Operational continuity hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P21.4: Governance Closure and Phase 22 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 21 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 22.

### TODOs
- [x] P21.4.1 Define objective Phase 21 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [x] P21.4.2 Add PHASE21↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [x] P21.4.3 Add Phase 22 block gate from Phase 21 checklist.
- [x] P21.4.4 Publish Phase 21 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 22 remains blocked unless Phase 21 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 21)

- [x] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [x] Cross-environment stability validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [x] Operational continuity hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [x] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [x] Phase 22 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
