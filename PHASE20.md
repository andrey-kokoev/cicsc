## CICSC Phase 20: Multi-Environment Assurance and Scale Transition Discipline

Phase 20 starts after Phase 19 closure and focuses on multi-environment
assurance while preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 20:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Multi-environment assurance validation closure
3. Scale-transition hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 21 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- multi-environment assurance is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- scale-transition hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P20.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 20 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P20.1.1 Freeze Phase 20 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P20.1.2 Publish Phase 20 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P20.1.3 Add Phase 20 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 20 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P20.2: Multi-Environment Assurance Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close multi-environment assurance validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [ ] P20.2.1 Freeze multi-environment assurance matrix and evidence contract.
- [ ] P20.2.2 Run multi-environment assurance required gates.
- [ ] P20.2.3 Publish multi-environment assurance closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Multi-environment assurance validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P20.3: Scale-Transition Hardening

### Outcome
Harden scale-transition checks for expanded deployments.

### TODOs
- [ ] P20.3.1 Freeze scale-transition hardening matrix and policy.
- [ ] P20.3.2 Add scale-transition verification harnesses.
- [ ] P20.3.3 Publish scale-transition closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Scale-transition hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P20.4: Governance Closure and Phase 21 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 20 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 21.

### TODOs
- [ ] P20.4.1 Define objective Phase 20 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P20.4.2 Add PHASE20↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P20.4.3 Add Phase 21 block gate from Phase 20 checklist.
- [ ] P20.4.4 Publish Phase 20 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 21 remains blocked unless Phase 20 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 20)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Multi-environment assurance validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Scale-transition hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 21 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
