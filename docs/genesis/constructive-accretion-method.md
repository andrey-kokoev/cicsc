# Constructive Accretion Method (CAM)

A method for growing a socio-technical compiler/runtime from theoretical bedrock
to field surface while preserving semantic closure at each step.

## 1. Motivation

The central problem is not feature accumulation.
It is preserving correctness while moving from abstract invariance theory to
real operational systems.

CAM defines that progression discipline.

## 2. Starting axiom

Begin from previously established theory:

- CIS defines invariance and constructive transformation requirements.

Then ask the constructive question:

what is required for human intent to be compiled into an executable system that
retains those invariants under evolution?

## 3. Practical forcing function

Use simple but representative socio-technical domains as stressors:

- ticketing
- CRM
- kanban

These domains expose concrete semantic obligations without overfitting to a
single vertical.

## 4. Core progression sequence

CAM follows this sequence:

1. Instantiate theory in toy-but-real domains.
2. Build executable semantics and run workloads.
3. Formalize kernel semantics and prove core coherence properties.
4. Expand outward by nearest safe step only.
5. Re-run evidence gates after each step.

## 5. Accretion rule

At each iteration, choose the smallest adjacent step that increases surface
area while preserving already-closed semantic layers.

No leapfrogging over unresolved interior layers.

## 6. No-bubbles constraint

A "bubble" is an unresolved semantic void hidden behind visible progress.

Examples:
- adding DSL sugar with weak type semantics,
- adding backend support without conformance evidence,
- declaring migration readiness without replay safety closure.

CAM forbids progression that leaves such bubbles behind.

## 7. Closure criterion per step

A step is admissible only if it is closed by evidence:

- executable checks,
- proof/test artifacts,
- updated contracts/docs where semantics changed.

If closure is missing, the step remains open regardless of implementation
volume.

## 8. Relationship to CIECP and WMCC

- CIECP supplies admissibility gates and canonical execution truth.
- WMCC supplies typed collaboration transport across worktrees.
- CAM supplies the growth law: how to choose and sequence the next step.

Together:
- CAM decides direction,
- CIECP decides admissibility,
- WMCC decides coordinated execution.

## 9. Limits

CAM is a progression discipline, not a proof system.
It does not replace CICSC semantic formalization; it constrains how
formalization and surface expansion are staged.

## 10. Summary

CAM is the method used in this project to grow from invariance theory to
production surface:

- theory first,
- executable stressors second,
- formal closure third,
- outward accretion under continuous evidence,
- no semantic cavities accepted.
