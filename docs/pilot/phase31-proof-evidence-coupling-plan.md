# Phase 31 Proof-Evidence Coupling Plan

Artifacts:
- `docs/pilot/phase31-proof-evidence-coupling-plan.json`

This plan defines the coupling rule for expanded-scope claims:
- each claim must declare a proof obligation class,
- each claim must provide executable evidence,
- claims with either side missing are non-admissible.
