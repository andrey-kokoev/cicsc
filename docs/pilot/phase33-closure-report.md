Artifact:
- `docs/pilot/phase33-closure-report.json`

This report closes `AX2.3` by publishing:
- Phase 33 closure findings tied to proof-evidence and formalization inputs,
- updated admissible-claims policy for expanded-scope claim classes.

Result:
- expanded-scope claims remain blocked for production until formalization gate
  requirements are admissible,
- declared-scope claims remain governed by Phase 30 objective verdict.
