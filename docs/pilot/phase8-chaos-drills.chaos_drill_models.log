(node:770153) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///home/andrey/src/cicsc/tests/runtime/phase8-chaos-drills.test.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /home/andrey/package.json.
