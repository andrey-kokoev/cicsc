# Phase 33 Admissible-Claims Policy

Artifact:
- `docs/pilot/phase33-admissible-claims-policy.json`

This policy updates Phase 33 claim admissibility:
- expanded-scope claim classes remain blocked until corresponding formalization
  gate requirements are admissible,
- production claims remain limited to Phase 30 declared scope while AX2.2 stays
  blocked for expanded classes,
- proof-evidence coupling remains mandatory but is not sufficient without the
  formalization gate.
