# Phase 32 Expanded-Scope Required Gates

Artifacts:
- `docs/pilot/phase32-expanded-scope-required-gates.json`

This report defines the required-gates contract for Phase 32 expanded scope by
checking OBJ1..OBJ5 envelope artifacts and their `overall` pass status.

The gate is expected to remain `fail` until all objective envelope artifacts are
implemented and passing.
