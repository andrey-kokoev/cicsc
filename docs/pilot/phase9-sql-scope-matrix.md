# Phase 9 SQL Scope Matrix

Artifact:
- `docs/pilot/phase9-sql-scope-matrix.json`

This matrix freezes the Phase 9 SQL capability envelope before implementation
of deferred constructs. Any new SQL construct must be represented here with:
- explicit status (`candidate` or `deferred`),
- gating rule,
- owner/date when deferred.
