# Phase 30 Objective Verdict Assertions

Artifacts:
- `docs/pilot/phase30-objective-verdict-assertions.json`

This artifact binds `OBJ1`..`OBJ5` to measurable `met`/`not_met` assertions with
required evidence artifacts.

Decision rule:
- Completion claim requires all objectives `met`.
- Any `not_met` objective blocks completion and triggers forced-next derivation.
