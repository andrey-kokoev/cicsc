# Phase 31 Objective Extension Contract

Artifacts:
- `docs/pilot/phase31-objective-extension-contract.json`

This contract extends OBJ1-OBJ5 acceptance envelopes without weakening Phase 30
objective closure guarantees.

Rules:
- existing objective verdict standards remain non-regressing;
- expanded claims are valid only through explicit gate-enforced artifacts;
- any `not_met` objective requires forced-next derivation.
