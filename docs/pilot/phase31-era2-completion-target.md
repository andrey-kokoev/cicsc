# Phase 31 Era 2 Completion Target

Artifacts:
- `docs/pilot/phase31-era2-completion-target.json`

This artifact defines the next-era completion boundary after Phase 30:
- move from declared-scope closure to expanded-scope closure,
- preserve current invariant/parity/migration guarantees,
- require explicit objective extensions and gate-backed evidence contracts.
