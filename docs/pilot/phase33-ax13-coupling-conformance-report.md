# Phase 33 AX1.3 Coupling Conformance Report

Artifact:
- `docs/pilot/phase33-ax13-coupling-conformance-report.json`

This report closes `AX1.3` by publishing:
- proof-evidence coupling conformance status for expanded claim classes,
- residual formalization gaps that still block expanded-scope admissibility.

Result:
- coupling conformance is `pass` for the declared Phase 33 envelope,
- residual gaps remain explicitly registered for Lean/kernel catch-up.
