# Security and Vulnerability Handling Process

## Reporting

- Private disclosure channel preferred for unpatched vulnerabilities.
- Public issue allowed for low-risk findings.

## Triage

- Classify severity: critical/high/medium/low.
- Identify affected layers: runtime, kernel, adapters, DSL/compiler.

## Response Targets

- Critical: immediate patch and advisory.
- High: patch within next patch release window.
- Medium/Low: scheduled patch with documented mitigation.

## Disclosure

- Publish advisory with impact, fix version, and migration guidance.
- Backport critical fixes to `lts/v1` when applicable.
