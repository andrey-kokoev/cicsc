## CICSC Phase 26: Stability Consolidation and Continuity Assurance Discipline

Phase 26 starts after Phase 25 closure and focuses on stability
consolidation while preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 26:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Stability-consolidation validation closure
3. Continuity-assurance hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 27 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- stability consolidation is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- continuity-assurance hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P26.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 26 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P26.1.1 Freeze Phase 26 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P26.1.2 Publish Phase 26 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [ ] P26.1.3 Add Phase 26 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 26 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P26.2: Stability-Consolidation Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close stability-consolidation validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [ ] P26.2.1 Freeze stability-consolidation matrix and evidence contract.
- [ ] P26.2.2 Run stability-consolidation required gates.
- [ ] P26.2.3 Publish stability-consolidation closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Stability-consolidation validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P26.3: Continuity-Assurance Hardening

### Outcome
Harden continuity-assurance checks for expanded deployments.

### TODOs
- [ ] P26.3.1 Freeze continuity-assurance hardening matrix and policy.
- [ ] P26.3.2 Add continuity-assurance verification harnesses.
- [ ] P26.3.3 Publish continuity-assurance closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Continuity-assurance hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P26.4: Governance Closure and Phase 27 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 26 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 27.

### TODOs
- [ ] P26.4.1 Define objective Phase 26 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P26.4.2 Add PHASE26↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P26.4.3 Add Phase 27 block gate from Phase 26 checklist.
- [ ] P26.4.4 Publish Phase 26 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 27 remains blocked unless Phase 26 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 26)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Stability-consolidation validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Continuity-assurance hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 27 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
