## CICSC Phase 12: Broad Deployment Generalization Under Kernel Discipline

Phase 12 starts after Phase 11 closure and expands deployment/generalization
evidence while preserving kernel invariants, conformance, and migration safety.

Execution sequence for Phase 12:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Multi-domain deployment expansion
3. Backend parity envelope widening
4. Governance closure and Phase 13 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- deployment evidence broadens beyond prior envelope without invariant regressions,
- backend equivalence confidence increases on widened declared surface,
- phase transition governance remains artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P12.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Begin Phase 12 from explicit scope/ownership and reproducible green baseline.

### TODOs
- [x] P12.1.1 Freeze Phase 12 scope and owner contract.
- [ ] P12.1.2 Publish Phase 12 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [ ] P12.1.3 Add Phase 12 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 12 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P12.2: Multi-Domain Deployment Expansion

### Outcome
Expand deployment evidence to additional domains under existing gate discipline.

### TODOs
- [ ] P12.2.1 Freeze expanded domain matrix and workload contract.
- [ ] P12.2.2 Run expanded multi-domain workload suites with required gates.
- [ ] P12.2.3 Publish deployment expansion report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Deployment expansion is evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P12.3: Backend Parity Envelope Widening

### Outcome
Increase parity confidence on widened declared SQL/backend envelope.

### TODOs
- [ ] P12.3.1 Freeze parity envelope extension matrix.
- [ ] P12.3.2 Add differential harnesses for newly included envelope items.
- [ ] P12.3.3 Publish parity envelope closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Parity envelope widening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P12.4: Governance Closure and Phase 13 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 12 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 13.

### TODOs
- [ ] P12.4.1 Define objective Phase 12 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P12.4.2 Add PHASE12↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P12.4.3 Add Phase 13 block gate from Phase 12 checklist.
- [ ] P12.4.4 Publish Phase 12 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 13 remains blocked unless Phase 12 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 12)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Deployment expansion is objective and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Parity envelope widening is differentially validated.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 13 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
