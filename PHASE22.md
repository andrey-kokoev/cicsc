## CICSC Phase 22: Resilience Expansion and Control-Surface Integrity Discipline

Phase 22 starts after Phase 21 closure and focuses on resilience expansion
while preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 22:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Resilience-expansion validation closure
3. Control-surface integrity hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 23 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- resilience expansion is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- control-surface integrity hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P22.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 22 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P22.1.1 Freeze Phase 22 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P22.1.2 Publish Phase 22 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P22.1.3 Add Phase 22 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 22 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P22.2: Resilience-Expansion Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close resilience-expansion validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [x] P22.2.1 Freeze resilience-expansion matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P22.2.2 Run resilience-expansion required gates.
- [x] P22.2.3 Publish resilience-expansion closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Resilience-expansion validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P22.3: Control-Surface Integrity Hardening

### Outcome
Harden control-surface integrity checks for expanded deployments.

### TODOs
- [x] P22.3.1 Freeze control-surface integrity hardening matrix and policy.
- [x] P22.3.2 Add control-surface integrity verification harnesses.
- [x] P22.3.3 Publish control-surface integrity closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Control-surface integrity hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P22.4: Governance Closure and Phase 23 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 22 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 23.

### TODOs
- [ ] P22.4.1 Define objective Phase 22 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [ ] P22.4.2 Add PHASE22↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P22.4.3 Add Phase 23 block gate from Phase 22 checklist.
- [ ] P22.4.4 Publish Phase 22 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 23 remains blocked unless Phase 22 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 22)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Resilience-expansion validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Control-surface integrity hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 23 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
