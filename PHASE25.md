## CICSC Phase 25: Verification Consolidation and Field Continuity Discipline

Phase 25 starts after Phase 24 closure and focuses on verification
consolidation while preserving semantic, migration, and governance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 25:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Verification-consolidation validation closure
3. Field-continuity hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 26 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- verification consolidation is evidence-backed across declared surfaces,
- field-continuity hardening is executable and policy-governed,
- phase transitions remain artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P25.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Start Phase 25 from explicit scope, owners, and reproducible baseline truth.

### TODOs
- [x] P25.1.1 Freeze Phase 25 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P25.1.2 Publish Phase 25 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P25.1.3 Add Phase 25 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 25 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P25.2: Verification-Consolidation Validation Closure

### Outcome
Close verification-consolidation validation with explicit evidence contract and findings governance.

### TODOs
- [x] P25.2.1 Freeze verification-consolidation matrix and evidence contract.
- [x] P25.2.2 Run verification-consolidation required gates.
- [x] P25.2.3 Publish verification-consolidation closure report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] Verification-consolidation validation remains evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P25.3: Field-Continuity Hardening

### Outcome
Harden field-continuity checks for expanded deployments.

### TODOs
- [x] P25.3.1 Freeze field-continuity hardening matrix and policy.
- [x] P25.3.2 Add field-continuity verification harnesses.
- [x] P25.3.3 Publish field-continuity closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [x] Field-continuity hardening remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P25.4: Governance Closure and Phase 26 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 25 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 26.

### TODOs
- [x] P25.4.1 Define objective Phase 25 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [x] P25.4.2 Add PHASE25↔Execution Ledger drift consistency gate.
- [x] P25.4.3 Add Phase 26 block gate from Phase 25 checklist.
- [x] P25.4.4 Publish Phase 25 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 26 remains blocked unless Phase 25 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 25)

- [x] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [x] Verification-consolidation validation is evidence-backed and invariant-preserving.
- [x] Field-continuity hardening is verifiable with executable harnesses.
- [x] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [x] Phase 26 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
