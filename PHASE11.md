## CICSC Phase 11: Envelope Expansion Under Equivalence Discipline

Phase 11 starts after Phase 10 closure and executes objective scorecard closure
work while preserving conformance, migration safety, and governance invariants.

Execution sequence for Phase 11:
1. Scope freeze and governance baseline
2. DSL usability broadening with objective evidence
3. Deferred SQL/parity closure under differential gates
4. Field deployment expansion and governance gate for Phase 12

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- Phase 10 partial objectives are converted into pass or explicit owner-dated deferral,
- SQL/backend equivalence is widened without weakening compile-time rejection policy,
- phase transition remains artifact-truth-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P11.1: Scope Freeze and Governance Baseline

### Outcome
Start Phase 11 with objective scope, ownership, and a stable gate baseline.

### TODOs
- [x] P11.1.1 Freeze Phase 11 scope and objective ownership contract.
- [x] P11.1.2 Publish Phase 11 baseline gate snapshot (parity/migration/ops/governance).
- [x] P11.1.3 Add Phase 11 status register with owner/date accountability.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 11 execution starts from explicit scope and reproducible baseline evidence.

---

## Milestone P11.2: DSL Usability Closure

### Outcome
Promote DSL usability objective from partial to pass using objective task evidence.

### TODOs
- [x] P11.2.1 Define non-programmer task suite and success rubric.
- [x] P11.2.2 Add reproducible usability harness and evidence artifact.
- [x] P11.2.3 Publish DSL usability closure report with residuals policy.

### Acceptance
- [x] DSL usability objective is evidence-backed beyond pilot anecdote.

---

## Milestone P11.3: SQL/Parity Deferred Closure

### Outcome
Address deferred SQL/parity items with explicit closure or governed deferral.

### TODOs
- [x] P11.3.1 Freeze deferred SQL/parity item ledger and closure plan.
- [x] P11.3.2 Add differential harnesses for selected deferred constructs.
- [x] P11.3.3 Publish deferred-item disposition report (closed vs deferred with owner/date).

### Acceptance
- [x] Deferred SQL/parity items are no longer implicit risk.

---

## Milestone P11.4: Deployment Expansion and Phase 12 Gate

### Outcome
Broaden deployment evidence while preserving invariant and governance discipline.

### TODOs
- [x] P11.4.1 Freeze expanded deployment set and workload contract.
- [x] P11.4.2 Run expanded workload suite with parity/migration/ops gates.
- [x] P11.4.3 Capture drift/performance/missing-primitive findings with severity labels.
- [x] P11.4.4 Add objective Phase 11 exit checklist and Phase 12 block gate.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 12 entry remains blocked unless Phase 11 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 11)

- [x] Scope, baseline, and status governance are explicit and reproducible.
- [x] DSL usability objective is closed or explicitly deferred with owner/date.
- [x] Deferred SQL/parity items are objectively dispositioned.
- [x] Expanded deployment evidence is captured under invariant-preserving gates.
- [x] Phase 12 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
