## CICSC Phase 14: Generalization and Adoption Readiness

Phase 14 starts after Phase 13 closure and focuses on widening real-world
generalization while preserving categorical and conformance guarantees.

Execution sequence for Phase 14:
1. Scope freeze and baseline continuity
2. Generalization envelope expansion
3. Adoption and operator-readiness hardening
4. Governance closure and Phase 15 gate

---

## Phase Objective

Reach a state where:
- real-world generalization expands without invariant regressions,
- operator/adoption readiness is explicit and measurable,
- transition governance remains artifact-backed and automation-enforced.

---

## Milestone P14.1: Scope Freeze and Baseline Continuity

### Outcome
Begin Phase 14 from explicit scope and reproducible baseline status.

### TODOs
- [x] P14.1.1 Freeze Phase 14 scope and owner contract.
- [x] P14.1.2 Publish Phase 14 baseline continuity snapshot.
- [x] P14.1.3 Add Phase 14 status register with owner/date discipline.

### Acceptance
- [x] Phase 14 starts from objective scope and reproducible baseline truth.

---

## Milestone P14.2: Generalization Envelope Expansion

### Outcome
Expand adoption/generalization envelope under strict conformance gates.

### TODOs
- [x] P14.2.1 Freeze generalization envelope matrix and workload contract.
- [x] P14.2.2 Run generalization workload suites with required gates.
- [x] P14.2.3 Publish generalization envelope report with findings disposition.

### Acceptance
- [x] Generalization expansion is evidence-backed with explicit findings governance.

---

## Milestone P14.3: Adoption and Operator-Readiness Hardening

### Outcome
Strengthen operator and adoption readiness as first-class governable artifacts.

### TODOs
- [x] P14.3.1 Freeze operator-readiness matrix (runbooks, SLO, diagnostics).
- [x] P14.3.2 Add readiness verification harnesses.
- [x] P14.3.3 Publish readiness closure report with residual policy.

### Acceptance
- [x] Operator readiness remains explicit, test-backed, and governed.

---

## Milestone P14.4: Governance Closure and Phase 15 Gate

### Outcome
Close Phase 14 with objective checklist and enforce entry gate for Phase 15.

### TODOs
- [x] P14.4.1 Define objective Phase 14 exit checklist mapped to artifacts.
- [x] P14.4.2 Add PHASE14↔ROADMAP drift consistency gate.
- [ ] P14.4.3 Add Phase 15 block gate from Phase 14 checklist.
- [ ] P14.4.4 Publish Phase 14 closure report and mark exit criteria.

### Acceptance
- [ ] Phase 15 remains blocked unless Phase 14 checklist is fully pass.

---

## Exit Criteria (Phase 14)

- [ ] Scope, baseline, and status governance remain explicit and reproducible.
- [ ] Generalization envelope expansion is objective and invariant-preserving.
- [ ] Adoption/operator readiness is verifiable and differentially validated.
- [ ] Governance checks enforce code/doc/artifact consistency.
- [ ] Phase 15 remains blocked without full checklist pass.
